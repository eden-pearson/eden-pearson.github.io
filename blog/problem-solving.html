      <div class="blog-entry">
        <p>
          This week we were given a bunch of JavaScript Kata challenges to
          solve. 'Kata' is a term that originates in martial arts and refers to
          a series of repetitive challenges used to master a certain skill.
          Solving these kata challenges has helped me to hone my problem solving
          methods.
        </p>
        <h3>A time I was blocked by a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
          I experienced feeling blocked when I was solving the deBee Kata. This
          challenge involved writing a javascript program that takes a string
          and case insensitively filters out the word 'buzz' and returns the
          string. I started by solving the problem using pseudocode:
        </p>
        <img src="../photos/pseudocode-deBee.png" id="pseudocode-deBee" />
        <p>
          Converting the first and last step of my pseudocode into code was easy
          as I knew I could use <code>split()</code> and <code>join()</code> to
          transition between strings and arrays. Knowing how to filter out the
          word buzz was a bit more tricky so I resorted to using google which
          gave me instructions for using the <code>filter()</code> method. I
          combined these three methods and I had a working function:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../photos/deBee-case-sensitive.png"
          id="deBee-case-sensitive"
        />
        <p>
          However, my function was only filtering out exact matches for 'buzz'.
          I needed to find a way to filter out all variations of the word buzz.
          I knew that the toLowerCase method existed so I incorporated this into
          my filter, however my program was continuously failing the tests. It
          got to the point where I was getting very frustrated because i thought
          I had done everything right yet my solution was still not working, so
          I decided it would be best to take a break and solve the problem with
          fresh eyes. I came back and revisited my function and that's when I
          finally realised the mistake I had made... I forgot to include the
          brackets after
          <code>toLowerCase</code> so it wasn't acting as a function. Once I
          added the brackets, my program passed all the tests and the challenge
          was solved.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../photos/deBee-case-insensitive.png"
          id="deBee-case-insensitive"
        />
        <p>
          I felt a sense of relief that the I had successfully solved the kata,
          however, I simultaneously felt like a huge idiot for getting so
          frustrated after making such a simple mistake. This situation
          definitely taught me the importance of carefully proofreading my code
          and making sure to get my syntax right.
        </p>
        <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
        <p>
          The 'FizzBuzz' kata required me to write a function that took a number
          and returned that number, unless it was divisible by 3, 5 or 15 in
          which case the program would return 'Fizz', 'Buzz' or 'FizzBuzz'
          respectively. I immediately saw this problem and thought that this
          would be a perfect opportunity to use conditional statements. I also
          remembered from last weeks javascript problem solving session that I
          could use the remainder operator. I first tackled the program by using
          pseudocode:
        </p>
        <img src="../photos/pseudocode-fizzbuzz.png" id="pseudocode-fizzbuzz" />
        <p>
          Then I replaced each section of my pseudocode with real code. During
          which I was careful to make sure that I wasn't returning 'Buzz' or
          'Fizz' for numbers that are divisible by 15:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../photos/initial-code-fizzbuzz.png"
          id="initial-code-fizzbuzz"
        />
        <p>
          Once I confirmed that my function was working I decided to refactor my
          code. I realised that due to the synchronous nature of javascript I
          could reorder my conditional statements and remove the need for the
          '&&' statements. Which lead my final code to look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="../photos/final-code-fizzbuzz.png" id="final-code-fizzbuzz" />
        <p>
          After I had successfully completed this challenge I felt a sense of
          pride as it finally felt like I was making progress with my problem
          solving skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Using different problem solving techniques:</h3>
        <p>
          Through solving the javascript kata I have realised that my favourite
          problem solving techniques are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>pseudocode</li>
          <li>console.logging</li>
          <li>googling</li>
          <li>reading error messages</li>
          <li>trying something</li>
          <li>improving my process with reflection</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Problem solving techniques I feel less confident about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>asking peers for help</li>
          <li>asking coaches for help</li>
          <li>rubber-ducky method</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          This weeks problem solving sessions has made it obvious to me that the
          techniques I am most reluctant to use is asking for help. This
          reluctance stems from a stubbornness to be able to solve all of my own
          problems and also a fear of being labeled as dumb if i am asking for
          help on a very simple problem. In future I am going to work on
          overcoming this reluctance by asking for help sooner rather than
          later.
