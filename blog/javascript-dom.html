        <h3>Let's talk javascript, HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript, HTML and CSS are all important parts of creating a dynamic webpage. So what role does each of these languages play?<br><br>
          Lets imagine the human body. HTML is would be the skeleton of a human body, it provides the structure of a website. CSS would be the skin and appearance of the human body, it provides the styling of a website. Javascript would be the nervous system of the body. It enables coordination between different parts of the body and allows the human body to create actions as a response to different inputs. It adds functionality to a website.

        <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
        <p>
          Control flow and loops are fundamental concepts of javascript. 
          Control flow is the order in which the javascript code is executed.
Loops allow you to repeat a certain part of the code until a certain condition is met
 <br /><br>
 I am going to use the example of going to the gym to explain control flow and loops.<br><br>The control flow:
 <ol>
  <li>Drive to the gym</li>
  <li>Swipe entry card</li>
  <li>Fill up water bottle</li>
  <li>Warmup and stretch</li>
  <li>Perform the strength training workout</li>
  <li>Cool down and stretch</li>
  <li>Exit the gym</li>
  <li>Drive home</li>
 </ol>
 A loop could be used for each exercise included in your strength training workout. Here's an example of a loop used to perform 3 sets of 10 reps of bench press:</p>

        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>
          The DOM (document object model) is another essential concept in web development. The DOM is a tree-like representation of a webpages HTML document. It allows Javascript to access and manipulate elements in a webpage.  </p>  
          <img src="../photos/DOM.webp" alt = "Diagram of the DOM" id ="DOM">
          <p>An example of how you might interact with the DOM is using <code>document.getElementById()</code> which retrieves an element from the DOM using its unique ID. Once the element has been retrieved we can then manipulate it using javascript. In the below example I retrieved a button element and changed its text from being blank to saying "Click me!"</p>
          <img src="../photos/button-HTML" id ="button-HTML"><br>
          <img src="../photos/button-transformation" id="button-transformation">
    
        <h3>Arrays and objects</h3>
        <p>An array is an ordered collection of data. The elements in an array are indexed starting from 0. To access data from an array you use the datas index value.</p>
          <img src = "../photos/array.png" alt="Example of an array named fruits" id ="array-fruits"> 
          <p>The console would log <code>apple</code>.</p>
          <p>To access properties within an object you use dot notation or bracket notation</p> 
          <img src="../photos/object.png" alt="Example of an object named person" id="object-person"> 
          <p>The console would log <code>Eden</code>.</p>
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Functions are helpful because they help organize your code and improve its readability. <br> <br> Here is an example of a function called multiply which takes two parameters and multiplies them together:</p>
      <img src="../photos/function.png" alt = "Example of a function named multiply" id="function-multiply"><p>The console would log <code>54</code>.</p>
