      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to find a fulfilling career in the tech industry.
        Currently, I aim to be a web developer hence why I am attending Dev
        Academy. Initially, I want to get a job as a junior developer to learn
        as much as possible from my peers, and then I will see what next steps
        make sense for my career progression. My background is in the healthcare
        industry, so I would love to find a job at the intersection between
        healthcare and technology. However, I am open to pursuing a career in
        whatever tech speciality feels right as long as the position challenges
        me and provides room for continuous growth.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> I am hard-working and persistent and will do
        what it takes to learn new information and meet my goals. I have strong
        research skills and am good at using the internet to find answers. I
        have experience with distance learning, which will be helpful when
        attending the online cohort of Dev Academy. <br /><br />
        <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
        I find it easy to get stuck down a rabbit hole and spend too long
        working on something relatively insignificant. I also avoid asking for
        help and instead try to find the answers to a problem myself, which is
        usually inefficient. Additionally, I sometimes avoid challenges in
        favour of sticking to what I'm good at. I am trying to adopt a new
        mindset where I actively seek out challenges and embrace them with an
        attitude that challenges are amazing for personal growth.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I want to develop my leadership and collaboration skills which I will do
        by participating in peer coding and group projects. I want to gain
        self-confidence in my abilities and decisions. I want to become a strong
        problem solver who embraces new challenges instead of sticking to my
        comfort zone.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will keep a strict study schedule to ensure that I am staying caught
        up in my coursework. I will be efficient with my time by using Toggl to
        manage my time on individual tasks. I will maintain effective
        communication with my peers and facilitators to ensure. I will keep a
        habit of tracking my goals and to-do list. I will embrace a growth
        mindset and remind myself that to grow, I need to embrace challenges.
        This will help me remain mentally resilient when the course becomes more
        difficult. I will also prioritize looking after my physical health, such
        as getting enough sleep, eating well and exercising. I will also seek
        emotional support from my family and friends as I need it.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I am stuck, I will first try to find a solution independently e.g.
        By thoroughly proofreading my code. If this doesn't work, I will use
        Google and Discord to see if other students have had a similar problem.
        If I still haven't found a solution, I will contact my peers and
        facilitators via Discord. During this, I will try my best to describe
        the issue and describe what I have already tried to do to fix it.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect that the facilitators will give me regular insightful feedback
        on what I am doing well and areas for improvement. I want to feel
        supported by the facilitation team and know they will be available to
        help me when I need it (during reasonable work hours). I also expect
        them to teach me industry best practices and the essential skills of a
        great programmer.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am fortunate enough to have minimal commitments and no dependents.
        However, I want to continue taking the time to do things that keep my
        mental and physical well-being in check. I will block out time for
        exercise each morning before 8:30 am. I will also dedicate a few hours
        on the weekend to connect with loved ones or do an activity that
        revitalizes me.
