      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to find a fulfilling career in the tech industry.
        Currently I aim to be a web developer hence why I am attending Dev
        Academy. Initially I want to get a job as a junior developer so that I
        can learn as much as possible from my peers and then I will what next
        steps make sense for my career progression. My background is in the
        healthcare industry, so I would love to find a job in the intersection
        between healthcare and technology. However, I am open to pursuing a
        career in whatever tech specialty feels right as long as I find a
        position that challenges me and provides room for continuous growth.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        Strengths: I am hard-working and persistent and will do what it takes to
        learn new information and meet my goals. I have strong research skills
        and am good at using the internet to find answers. I have experience
        with distance learning which will be useful when attending the online
        cohort of Dev Academy. Weaknesses: I find it easy to get stuck down a
        rabbit hole and spend too long working on something relatively
        insignificant. I also avoid asking for help and instead try and find the
        answers to a problem myself but this is often inefficient. Additionally
        I sometimes avoid challenges in favour of sticking to what I'm good at.
        I am trying to adopt a new mindset where I actively seek out challenges
        and embrace them with a mindset that challenges are good for personal
        growth.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I want to develop my leadership and collaboration skills which I will do
        by participating in peer coding and group projects. I want to gain
        self-confidence in my abilities and decisions. I want to become a strong
        problem solver who embraces new challenges instead of sticking to my
        comfort zone.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will keep to a strict study schedule to ensure that I am not falling
        behind in my coursework. I will be efficient with my time by using Toggl
        to manage the time I spend on individuals tasks. I will maintain
        effective communication with my peers and facilitators to ensure . I
        will maintain a habit of tracking my goals and to do list I will embrace
        a growth mindset remind myself that in order to grow I need to embrace
        challenges. This will help me to remain mentally resilient when the
        course is becoming more difficult. I will also prioritize looking after
        my physical health such as getting enough sleep, eating well and
        exercising. I will seek emotional support from my family and friend
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I am stuck I will first try to find a solution independently e.g.
        by thoroughly proofreading my code. If this doesn’t work then I will use
        google and check Discord to see if other students have had a similar
        problem. If I still haven't found a solution then I will reach out to my
        peers and facilitators via discord. During which I will try my best to
        describe the issue and describe what I have already tried to do to fix
        it.
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect that the facilitators will give me regular insightful feedback
        on what I am doing well and areas for improvement. I want to feel
        supported by the facilitation team and know that they will be available
        to help me when I need it (during reasonable work hours). I also expect
        them to teach me industry best practices and the most important skills
        of a great programmer.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am fortunate enough to have minimal commitments and no dependents.
        However, I want to continue taking the time to do things that keep my
        mental and physical wellbeing in check. I will block out time for
        exercise each morning before 8:30am. I will also dedicate a few hours on
        the weekend to connect with loved ones and/or do an activity that
        revitalizes myself.
