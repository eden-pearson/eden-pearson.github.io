          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The importance of subduing my ego to allow for authentic
            self-expression. I have learned to recognize when my ego hinders my
            ability to communicate well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Through the core learning experience, I have gained confidence in my
            ability to analyze complex issues and find innovative solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perhaps most surprising to me is the revelation that I possess the
            capability to grasp intricate coding concepts.
          </li>

        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the realm of programming, values, empathy, and self-awareness play
          vital roles. Firstly, having empathy towards oneself is crucial when
          learning to code, considering the inherently challenging and gradual
          nature of the process. Additionally, empathy towards others is
          essential as programming often involves collaborative teamwork.
          Self-awareness is a fundamental aspect of growth as a programmer. By
          reflecting on our strengths, weaknesses, and biases, we can identify
          areas for improvement. Self-awareness empowers us to leverage our
          strengths effectively, address weaknesses, and mitigate biases that
          may hinder our problem-solving abilities. Values provide a moral
          compass for our programming endeavours. They shape our problem-solving
          approaches and guide our software development practices. Upholding
          strong values ensures ethical and responsible coding practices,
          fostering a positive impact in the digital realm.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most astounding aspect of my core learning journey has been the
          unexpected enjoyment I derived from it. Initially skeptical, I entered
          this experience with the belief that it could potentially be a futile
          use of time. However, to my surprise, I discovered immense
          satisfaction and fulfillment in the process.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Engaging in self-analysis presented a considerable challenge
          throughout the core learning process. Assessing my own strengths and
          weaknesses proved to be a daunting task, requiring introspection and
          critical evaluation. Moreover, establishing a daily practice of
          mindfulness meditation has been challenging to incorporate into my
          routine.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think Dev Academy, a programming school, are spending so
          much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dev Academy prioritizes core learning within their web development
          Bootcamp course because they recognize that being proficient in coding
          alone does not make a candidate truly employable. In order to produce
          well-rounded individuals who can thrive in a professional environment,
          it is essential to foster qualities beyond technical skills. Skills
          such as effective teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, and
          embracing challenges are nurtured through core learning, making
          graduates more versatile and valuable to potential employers.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
          instead?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely not. I firmly believe that the time dedicated to studying
          core learning has been far from wasteful. In fact, it has
          significantly enhanced my programming abilities. Core learning has
          equipped me with valuable problem-solving techniques, enabling me to
          approach challenges with a systematic plan rather than relying solely
          on brute force. Moreover, learning about neuroplasticity and embracing
          a growth mindset has revolutionized my perception of obstacles.
          Instead of succumbing to overwhelm and giving up, I now confront
          challenges head-on, persevering through them. This shift in mindset
          has not only transformed my coding skills but also cultivated
          resilience and determination, qualities that transcend the realm of
          programming and positively impact all aspects of my life.
