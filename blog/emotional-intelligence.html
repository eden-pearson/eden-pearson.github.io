        <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand and
          manage your own emotions as well as recognize, understand and
          influence the emotions of people around you. <br><br />There are five key
          elements to emotional intelligence:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Self-awareness - The ability to recognize and understand ones own
            emotions, abilities and values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-regulation - The ability to manage and regulate ones own
            emotions and reactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation - being self-motivated and having a strong internal drive
            to achieve goals and persevere during challenges
          </li>
          <li>
            Empathy - The ability to perceive and interpret others' emotions

        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ:</h3>
        <p>
          IQ measures a persons cognitive abilities and intellectual potential.
          It focuses on skills such as problem-solving, analytical skills,
          memory and logical reasoning. IQ determines how well an individual can
          understand and process information. <br /><br>
          EQ measures how well an individual can understand and manage emotions.
          It focuses on the skills outlined above: self-awareness,
          self-regulation, empathy, motivation and social skills. EQ determines
          how well someone can navigate social situations, communicate
          effectively and exhibit empathy towards others.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is EQ important</h3>
        <p>
          Q plays a significant role in professional success, leadership
          effectiveness, quality of relationships, mental health, and overall
          well-being. By developing our emotional intelligence, we can cultivate
          more fulfilling relationships, excel in our careers, and lead more
          balanced and satisfying lives.<br /><br>Some research to back this up:
          <ul>
            <li>TalentSmart found that EQ accounts for 58% of job performance across
              all job types, surpassing other factors like IQ and technical skills.</li>
            <li>The University of California found individuals with higher emotional
                intelligence had greater overall life satisfaction and reported higher
                levels of happiness and well-being. </li>
            <li>A survey by CareerBuilder found
                  that 71% of employers value emotional intelligence over IQ when hiring
                  and promoting employees.</li>
            <li>The Consortium for Research on Emotional
                    Intelligence in Organizations found that EQ training programs resulted
                    in improved employee performance, enhanced leadership effectiveness,
                    stronger teamwork, and reduced turnover rates.</li>
          <li> A study published in
                      the Journal of Applied Psychology found that leaders with higher EQ
                      exhibited better leadership effectiveness, including higher job
                      performance ratings and greater employee satisfaction.</li>
          </ul>
