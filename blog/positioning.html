        Absolute, relative and fixed positioning: What's the difference?
      </h1>
      <div class="blog-entry">
        <p>
          First we need to picture every element on a website as a separate
          block. Positioning refers to where exactly that block is sitting on
          the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start of with I have created three elements. By default all
          elements have static positioning. Which means that the elements will
          move when you scroll through the webpage.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-initial.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>position: <span>relative</span></h3>
        <p>
          Notice when I change the relative positioning of the yellow element,
          the other two elements are unaffected. The element will move a certain
          amount of pixels away from the side that you specify. Here I have told
          the element to move 50 pixels away from the right side and 20 pixels
          away from the top side. There is essentially a placeholder for your
          elements default positioning, so the neighboring elements won't move.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-relative.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>position: <span>absolute</span></h3>
        <p>
          When you give an element absolute positioning it gets removed from the
          normal document flow, so there is no placeholder for the elements
          original position. Which means that the other elements move to fill up
          the space that the element previously held. As you can see the red and
          green elements have moved to fill the space that the yellow element
          used to occupy, which causes the elements to appear overlapped.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-absolute.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>position: <span>fixed</span></h3>
        <p>
          The fixed position is similar to the absolute position. Here you can
          see that the yellow block appears to have the same positioning even
          though we have changed from absolute to relative positioning.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-fixed.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <p>
          However, you'll notice the difference when you scroll around the
          webpage. The fixed block remains in the exact same position on the web
          browser. Notice that the yellow block has stayed in the same spot
          while the other two blocks have moved as I scrolled through the page.
          Fixed positioning is very useful when creating a navigation bar on a
          website as you want this navigation bar to be visible as you scroll
          through the webpages content. Fixed elements are completely
          independent of everything else on the webpage.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-fixed-scrolled.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>To Recap</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="recap"><span>Relative:</span> The new positioning is relative to an elements
            original positioning.</li>
            <li class="recap">
            <span>Absolute:</span> The new positioning is irrespective of an elements original positioning and instead is defined in terms of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li class="recap">
              <span>Fixed:</span>
          The new position is irrespective of an elements original position and
          the element will stay in the exact same spot even when the
          webpage is scrolled.
            </li>
        </ul>
