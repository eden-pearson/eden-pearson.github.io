        Absolute, relative and fixed positioning: What's the difference?
      </h1>
      <div class="blog-entry">
        <p>
          When it comes to designing webpages, positioning plays a crucial role in determining how elements are arranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start with, I have created three elements. By default, these elements will all have static positioning. Elements that are statically positioned will appear on the page in what we call the normal flow, which refers to the default positioning of elements when no styling properties are applied.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-initial.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>Relative</h3>
        <p>
          When you apply relative positioning to an element, it maintains its position in the normal flow. This means that there is essentially a placeholder for your
          element's original positioning, so the neighbouring elements won't move when you reposition your element. You can use the <code>top</code> <code>bottom</code> <code>left</code>and <code>right</code> commands to specify how many pixels you want to move your element away from its original position.
         Here I have told
          the yellow element to move 50 pixels away from the right side and 20 pixels
          away from the top side. Notice how the red and green elements were unaffected when I changed the relative positioning of the yellow element.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-relative.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>Absolute</h3>
        <p>
          When you apply absolute positioning to an element, it gets removed from the
          normal document flow, so there is no placeholder for the element's
          original position. This means that the other elements will move to fill up
          the space that the element previously held. You can reposition the element using the <code>top</code> <code>bottom</code> <code>left</code>and <code>right</code> commands. However, this will specify the position relative to the viewport (the visible area of the browser window). 
          Below I have repositioned the yellow element, and as a result, the red and
          green elements have moved to fill the space that the yellow element
          used to occupy.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-absolute.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, we have fixed positioning. This is similar to absolute positioning in that the element's position is determined with respect to the viewport. Here you can
          see that the yellow element appears to have the same positioning even
          though we have changed from absolute to relative positioning.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-fixed.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <p>
       
  However, you'll notice the difference when you scroll around the
  webpage, as a fixed element will always remain in the same position on your screen. Notice that the yellow block has stayed in the same spot
  while the other two elements have moved down as I scrolled up the page.
  Fixed positioning is advantageous when creating a navigation bar on a
  website, as you want this navigation bar to be visible as you scroll
  through the webpage's content. 
        </p>
        <img
          src="/photos/blocks-fixed-scrolled.png"
          alt="Screenshot of code showing three different coloured blocks"
          class="positioning-image"
        />
        <h3>To Recap</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="recap"><code>position: relative</code> The element remains in the normal flow and is repositioned relative to its
            original positioning.</li>
            <li class="recap">
            <code>position: absolute</code> The positioning is determined with respect to the viewport and the element is removed from the normal flow.
            </li>
            <li class="recap">
              <code>position: fixed</code>
          The positioning is determined with respect to the viewport and
          the element will stay in the exact same spot even when the
          webpage is scrolled.
            </li>
        </ul>
