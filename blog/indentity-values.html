      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A co-worker of mine was in charge of creating a marketing campaign for
        an HIV medication. As they were presenting their campaign strategy to
        me, they made quite a few comments and assumptions about their target
        audience that were homophobic. I then had to decide whether or not to
        confront this person about their behaviour. Part of me did not want to
        say anything as this co-worker was considerably more senior than me, and
        I didn't want to ruin our working relationship. After weighing up my
        options I decided that the right thing to do would be to use open
        communication and confront this co-worker to let them know that their
        actions were wrong. Fortunately, this co-worker took my feedback on
        board and re-evaluated their marketing campaign. Upon reflection, I am
        glad I chose to confront my co-worker, and I think we are both better
        off for it.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my family education is highly valued, which helped push me towards
        getting a University degree. I also come from a very loving and
        supportive family which has led me to be loving and supportive of
        others. While at university I made many friends who are all very
        intelligent and hard-working people, which has inspired me to do my best
        to emulate those qualities in myself. In todays day and age I think that
        we are also largely influenced by the people that we surround ourself
        with on social media. Hence, I aim to follow people that exhibit
        qualities that I wish to embrace myself.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some of my strengths include being logical, persistent, a good team
        player. I also have a passion for learning which will come in handy
        during dev Academy as there will be an abundance of opportunities for me
        to learn new things.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some of my limitations include being introverted, a slow decision maker
        and being risk adverse. Being introverted means I’ll want to withhold
        from participating in class discussions and am less likely to ask
        questions when I need to. I also have a lack of self confidence so I’m
        less likely to volunteer my answer to questions.

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why
      </h2>
      <p>
        Last year I was tasked with organizing a fundraising event at work with
        a small group of my colleagues. We all had different ideas for which
        direction to take for our event and couldn't agree on which one was best
        which caused tensions to arise. At first we started leaning towards the
        idea of the loudest person in the group as they were the most insistent
        with their idea. However, I decided that we should all get an equal
        chance to share our ideas. We did this and then we took a vote to decide
        which was the best option. This was effective and caused us to
        eventually agree on a single direction to take our event. In future I
        would take a more collaborative approach and combine aspects of multiple
        peoples ideas rather than focusing on a single persons idea.
