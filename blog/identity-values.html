      <h1 class="blog-title">My identity and values</h1>
      <div class="blog-entry">
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          A co-worker of mine was in charge of creating a marketing campaign for
          an HIV medication. As they presented their campaign strategy to me,
          they made quite a few comments and assumptions about their target
          audience that were homophobic. I then had to decide whether or not to
          confront this person about their behaviour. Part of me did not want to
          say anything as this co-worker was considerably more senior than me,
          and I didn't want to ruin our working relationship. After weighing my
          options, I decided that the right thing to do would be to use open
          communication and confront this co-worker to let them know their
          actions were wrong. Fortunately, this co-worker took my feedback on
          board and re-evaluated part of their marketing campaign. Upon
          reflection, I am glad I chose to confront my co-worker, and I think we
          are both better off for it.

        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity
        </h3>
        <p>
          In my family, education is highly valued, which helped push me towards
          getting a University degree. I also come from a very loving and
          supportive family, which has led me to be loving and supportive of
          others. While at university, I have made many intelligent and
          hard-working friends, which inspires me to do my best to emulate those
          qualities in myself. In today's day and age, we are also largely
          influenced by the people we surround ourselves with on social media.
          Hence, I aim to follow people with qualities I wish to embrace myself.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My strengths include being logical, persistent, and a good team
          player. I also have a passion for learning which will come in handy
          during Dev Academy as opportunities will be abundant for me to learn
          new things.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My limitations include being introverted, a slow decision-maker, and
          risk-averse. Being introverted means I'll want to withhold from
          participating in class discussions and am less likely to ask questions
          when needed.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why
        </h3>
        <p>
          Last year I was tasked with organizing a fundraising event with a
          small group of my colleagues. We all had different ideas for which
          direction to take for our event and couldn't agree on which one was
          best, which caused tensions to arise. At first, we started leaning
          towards the idea of the loudest person in the group as they were the
          most insistent with their concept. However, I decided we should all
          have an equal chance to share our ideas. We did this, and then we took
          a vote to determine which was the best option. Using democracy was
          effective and caused us to agree on a single direction to take our
          event eventually. In future, I would take a more collaborative
          approach and combine aspects of multiple people's ideas rather than
          focusing on a single person's idea.
