        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain change and form new neural
          connections especially in response to experiences. Understanding the
          principles of neuroplasticity is empowering as it lets us embrace the
          idea that our abilities are not fixed but can be improved through
          deliberate practice and perseverance.<br /><br />I plan on engaging
          with the principles of neuroplasticity by embracing challenges and
          practicing deliberate practice. I will also remind myself about the
          principles of neuroplasticity when I am struggling. <br /><br />
          We can increase our neuroplasticity by learning a new skill such as a
          new language, playing an instrument, painting or drawing. Additionally
          practicing meditation, physical exercise and engaging in social
          interactions can increase our neuroplasticity.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is a term coined by psychologist Carol Dweck which
          refers to the belief that our abilities and intelligence can be
          developed through dedication, hard work, and resilience. It contrasts
          with a fixed mindset, which assumes that our qualities and
          capabilities are fixed and unchangeable. People who have a growth
          mindset are more likely to embrace challenges, have a higher
          persistence and see failures as opportunities for growth.<br /><br />I
          used to view success as getting the right answer and proving my innate
          intelligence. After learning about growth mindset, I am going to start
          viewing success as anytime that I experience personal growth
          regardless of the overall outcome.<br /><br />
          I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by actively
          seeking out and embracing challenges and seeing them as an opportunity
          for growth. I will value effort and perseverance instead of solely
          seeking successful outcomes. I will also actively seek constructive
          feedback from facilitators and peers to use as a tool for personal
          growth and development.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          With neuroplasticity in mind, I am going to approach my learning plan
          with a focus on deliberate practice and continuous improvement. I am
          also going to keep up my habits of physical exercise and practicing
          mindfulness. I will incorporate a growth mindset by embracing a
          positive attitude toward challenges and failures. Instead of being
          discouraged by setbacks, I will see them as opportunities for learning
          and improvement.
